ASSIGNMENT 1
- see that the optimum lattice const is 10.4 Bohr, which is 5.3486 A
- Need to check if this is the lattice const of Si in lit

ASSIGNMENT 2

ASSIGNMENT 4: Graphite
TODO: change create_submit.sh 
- Have in principle two dimensions that should be optimized
- Values given are pretty good. Can take several points in steps 0.1 away
- Should provide a "hit map" 
- If problems converging, can try to first optimize only cdim(1)
